Starter Vagrantfiles
====================

This repo contains starter `Vagrantfile` templates with any other dependencies for a variety of projects, such as WordPress, Symfony2, Node.js/Express and Ruby on Rails.

These are designed to be the basis of your project repository, and you should start your project using one of these templates. Feel free to pull out bits and pieces though.

We use Puppet to provision the Vagrant boxes, and Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin) for the OS.
